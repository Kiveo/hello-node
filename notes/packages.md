# NPM

NPM comes shipped with an installation of Node.js

Npm allows us to use third party packages

The project will end up being a combination of code sources. 

--* <Developer> 
--* <Node Core Packages>
--* <Dependencies>

The dependencies are essentially the packages we install/manage via NPM and track with the package.json file.
